# DirectN
 # .NET 10 - Direct3D11 minimal sample.
 This sample has been ported to C# from here: https://gist.github.com/d7samurai/261c69490cce0620d0bfc93003cd1052 which features a minimal Direct3D11 "uncluttered direct3d 11 setup and rendering primer for newcomers to the api" sample.
 
 It's dependent on DirectN, .NET 10, Windows Forms and ... that's it. Here is the output (believe me, it rotates):

 Note: the code still works with .NET Core 3.1 to 5, it's just a project configuration matter.
