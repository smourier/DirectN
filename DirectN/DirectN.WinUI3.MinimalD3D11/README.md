# DirectN
 # WinUI3 .NET 10 - Direct3D11 minimal sample.
 This sample has been ported to C# from here: https://gist.github.com/d7samurai/abab8a580d0298cb2f34a44eec41d39d which features a minimal Direct3D11 *"'API familiarizer' - an uncluttered Direct3D 11 setup & basic rendering reference implementation, in the form of a complete, runnable Windows application contained in a single function and laid out in a linear, step-by-step fashion"* sample.

 It's dependent on DirectN, .NET 10, WinUI3 (using **SwapChainPanel** https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.swapchainpanel), and ... that's it. Here is the output (believe me, it rotates):
